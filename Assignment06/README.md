In this assignment I have created a landing page for a handicraft e-commerce and another page for login.

First, I used a normal CSS method to create the application
Next, I started to take that CSS as reference and created a SCSS folder
Inside Scss folder --> I created a style.scss, which acts as my main file where I imported all the other scss.
I clicked on Start Watching which created a css folder and also a style.css file inside it.

As mentioned in assignment I have used SASS Features
-> Variables
-> Custom Properties
-> Nesting
-> Interpolation
-> Placeholder Selectors
-> Mixins
-> Functions
-> Loops
-> Partials
-> File Organization

The generated CSS file from SCSS is linked in my landing page.
